### About Me: 💻🥷🏽 

ML engineer / Security Analyst looking into the use of data, machine learning, Threat Intelligence and Statistics for Threat Detection, Risk Management, and Incident Response. My goal is to help cybersecurity practitioners develop the skills to build tools and analysts to make faster and more accurate decisions based on verifiable data that can approximate an instantaneous and dynamic view of the ground truth.

### Mission Statement: 💼🦾 

We live in a time of great technological transformation, introducing new capabilities in XR, Cloud, IIoT and AI. With this novelty however, comes hightened risks to systems from various new attack vectors. Novel ways of handling these emerging threats therefore must also rise to meet these new challenges.

### What to Expect: 🤷🏽‍♂️🔮 

**SecOps** work, School Projects, Personal Projects, **Threat Hunting** Walkthroughs, **Detection Engineering** Rulesets, Powershell Scripts, Security Configurations, Python scripting for Ghidra, and **Data Science** techinques for security such as Markov Chains for Fraud Detection, Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection, Data Mining for **Threat Intel** and more.

### Collaboration: 👯🤝 

Open to collaborating on projects in data science, cybersecurity or XR spaces. Willing to work with people from around the globe in need of data-driven or ML assisted cybersecurity solutions. Open to discussing further in private. DMs welcome.
