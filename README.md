### About Me: 💻🥷🏽 

ML engineer / Security Analyst looking to leverage Data Analysis, Threat Intelligence, and Machine Learning for Threat Detection and Incident Response. 

### Mission Statement: 💼🦾 

We live in a time of great technological transformation, introducing new capabilities in fields of Cloud, IIoT and AI. With this novelty comes hightened risks from various new attack vectors. Novel ways of handling these emerging threats must therefore also rise to meet these new challenges. Equally important to me is to ensure the efficient and effective use of data to supplement the acheivement of business objectives.

### What to Expect: 🤷🏽‍♂️🔮 

**Data Engineering**, **SecOps**, Personal Projects, **Threat Hunting** Walkthroughs, **Detection Engineering** Rulesets, Powershell Scripts, Security Configurations, Python scripting, and **Data Science** techinques for security such as Markov Chains for Fraud Detection, Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection, Data Mining for **Threat Intel** and more.

### Collaboration: 👯🤝 

Open to collaborating on projects in data science and/or cybersecurity. DMs welcome.
