### About Me: 💻🥷🏽 

ML engineer / Security Analyst looking to use data, machine learning, Threat Intelligence, Threat Detection, and Incident Response. My goal is to help analysts make faster and better informed data driven decisions.

### Mission Statement: 💼🦾 

We live in a time of great technological transformation, introducing new capabilities in fields such as XR, Cloud, IIoT and AI. With this novelty comes hightened risks from various new attack vectors. Novel ways of handling these emerging threats must therefore also rise to meet these new challenges. 

### What to Expect: 🤷🏽‍♂️🔮 

**SecOps** work, Personal Projects, **Threat Hunting** Walkthroughs, **Detection Engineering** Rulesets, Powershell Scripts, Security Configurations, Python scripting for Ghidra, and **Data Science** techinques for security such as Markov Chains for Fraud Detection, Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection, Data Mining for **Threat Intel** and more.

### Collaboration: 👯🤝 

Open to collaborating on projects in data science, cybersecurity or XR. DMs welcome.
